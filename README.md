# evernote-sync-service

Easy to use evernote client service. I started this repo, because I wanted to use the Evernote API in my Go application, but Evernote does not provide any sdk for Go.

The project contains a lightweight python service running in a Docker container, with endpoints to fetch Evernote notebooks and notes. 

Usage
-----

After cloning the project run:
```
make
```
